The steps required to perform quality control are as follows:
1. Download the CEL files from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE90763
2. Separate the CEL files into three folders, where a folder is a specific time point, say T0, T1 
   or T2
3. For each folder, place the specific QC R script. For instance, for folder T0, place QC_T0.R; 
   folder T1, Place QC_T1.R and so forth
4. Run QC_T0.c, QC_T1.R and QC_T2.R in their respective folders
