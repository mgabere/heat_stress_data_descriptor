The steps required to perform preprocessing, mapping of probesets into correct gene ID and finding differential expressed 
genes (DEG) are:
1. Download the CEL files from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE90763
2. Place all CEL files in one folder
3. Run brainyarray_cdf.R in R as source("brainyarray_cdf.R"). This will create 
   Heat_stress_expression_brainy_V19.csv.
4. Remove "AFY**" probes from Heat_stress_expression_brainy_V19.csv.
5. Perform repeated measure using Generalized Linear Mixed Model (SAS code) in order to determine DEG.

In order to determine diffential expressed genes, you will need the following:
1.The analysis SAS code for the gene expression (GEE_analysis_25percent_final_pub2018)
2.The Expression file that was used for the differential genes analysis in CSV form (expression_heatstress_three_time_points_190815.csv

As for the statistics for RTPCR validation, you will need the following:
1. The analysis SAS code for the gene validation (Analysis-RTPCR)
2  Two datasets for the RTPCR validation in sas format.
